  abstract = {High-accuracy               ab initio               folding has remained an elusive objective despite decades of effort. To explore the folding landscape of villin headpiece subdomain HP35, we conducted two sets of replica exchange molecular dynamics for 200 ns each and three sets of conventional microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, using AMBER FF03 force field and a generalized-Born solvation model. The protein folded consistently to the native state; the lowest C               {$\alpha$}               -rmsd from the x-ray structure was 0.46 {\AA}, and the C               {$\alpha$}               - rmsd of the center of the most populated cluster was 1.78 {\AA} at 300 K.               ab initio               simulations have previously not reached this level. The folding landscape of HP35 can be partitioned into the native, denatured, and two intermediate-state regions. The native state is separated from the major folding intermediate state by a small barrier, whereas a large barrier exists between the major folding intermediate and the denatured states. The melting temperature               T               m               = 339 K extracted from the heat-capacity profile was in close agreement with the experimentally derived               T               m               = 342 K. A comprehensive picture of the kinetics and thermodynamics of HP35 folding emerges when the results from replica exchange and conventional molecular dynamics simulations are combined.},

  abstract = {Although thermal transport is among the essential biophysical properties of proteins, its relationship with protein structures, dynamics, and functions is still elusive. The structures of folded proteins are highly inhomogeneous, giving rise to an anisotropic and non-uniform flow of thermal energy during conformational fluctuations. To illustrate the nature of proteins, we developed a theoretical framework for analyzing local thermal transport properties based on the autocorrelation function formalism, constructed a linear-homopolymer-like model, and applied it to a small {$\alpha$}-helical protein, the villin headpiece subdomain (HP36), using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, the model reproduced the exact value of the protein's thermal conductivity with an error of less than 1\%. Interestingly, the site-selective analysis of the local, residue-wise, thermal conductivity demonstrated its distinct residue-type dependence, i.e., its magnitude decreased in the order of charged, polar, and hydrophobic residues. In addition, the local density dependence of the residue-wise thermal transport property was also discussed.},
