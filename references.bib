Five of them can alternatively be activated by nonthermal stimuli such as capsaicin [transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)] or hypo-osmolarity (TRPV2 and TRPV4). No nonthermal stimuli have yet been described for TRPV3, a warmth-gated ion channel expressed prominently in skin keratinocytes. Here, we demonstrate that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a compound used to inhibit store-operated Ca               2+               channels and IP               3               receptors, produces robust activation of recombinant TRPV3 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with an EC               50               of 28 {$\mu$}               m               . 2-APB also sensitizes TRPV3 to activation by heat, even at subthreshold concentrations. In inside-out membrane patches from TRPV3-expressing cells, 2-APB increases the open probability of TRPV3. Also, whereas heat alone is capable of activating TRPV3-mediated currents in only a small proportion of primary mouse keratinocytes, 2-APB activates heat-evoked, TRPV3-mediated currents in the majority of these cells. Together, these findings identify 2-APB as the first known chemical activator of TRPV3 and enhance the notion that TRPV3 participates in the detection of heat by keratinocytes.},

The web environment provides an ideal platform to build and validate a molecular model system in an interactive fashion such that, if a problem is found through visual inspection, one can go back to the previous setup and regenerate the whole system again. In this article, we describe the currently available functional modules of CHARMM-GUI Input Generator that form a basis for the advanced simulation techniques.

  abstract = {High-accuracy               ab initio               folding has remained an elusive objective despite decades of effort. To explore the folding landscape of villin headpiece subdomain HP35, we conducted two sets of replica exchange molecular dynamics for 200 ns each and three sets of conventional microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, using AMBER FF03 force field and a generalized-Born solvation model. The protein folded consistently to the native state; the lowest C               {$\alpha$}               -rmsd from the x-ray structure was 0.46 {\AA}, and the C               {$\alpha$}               - rmsd of the center of the most populated cluster was 1.78 {\AA} at 300 K.               ab initio               simulations have previously not reached this level. The folding landscape of HP35 can be partitioned into the native, denatured, and two intermediate-state regions. The native state is separated from the major folding intermediate state by a small barrier, whereas a large barrier exists between the major folding intermediate and the denatured states. The melting temperature               T               m               = 339 K extracted from the heat-capacity profile was in close agreement with the experimentally derived               T               m               = 342 K. A comprehensive picture of the kinetics and thermodynamics of HP35 folding emerges when the results from replica exchange and conventional molecular dynamics simulations are combined.},

  abstract = {Vanilloid receptors of the transient receptor potential family have functions in thermal sensation and nociception. Among them, transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)3 displays a unique property by which the repeated stimulation causes successive increases in its activity. The property has been known as sensitization and is observed in both native cells and cells heterologously expressing TRPV3. Transient increases in intracellular calcium levels have been implicated to play a key role in this process by mediating interaction of calmodulin with the channel. In support of the mechanism, BAPTA, a fast calcium chelator, accelerates the sensitization, whereas the slow chelator EGTA is ineffectual. Here, we show that the sensitization of TRPV3 also occurred independently of Ca2+. It was observed in both inside-out and outside-out membrane patches. BAPTA, but not EGTA, has a direct potentiation effect on channel activation. Analogues of BAPTA lacking Ca2+-buffering capability were similarly effective. The stimulation-induced sensitization and the potentiation by BAPTA are distinguishable in reversibility. We conclude that the sensitization of TRPV3 is intrinsic to the channel itself and occurs as a result of hysteresis of channel gating. BAPTA accelerates the sensitization process by potentiating the gating of the channel.},

  abstract = {Mechanical and thermal cues stimulate a specialized group of sensory neurons that terminate in the skin. Three members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of channels are expressed in subsets of these neurons and are activated at distinct physiological temperatures. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel thermosensitive TRP channel. TRPV3 has a unique threshold: It is activated at innocuous (warm) temperatures and shows an increased response at noxious temperatures. TRPV3 is specifically expressed in keratinocytes; hence, skin cells are capable of detecting heat via molecules similar to those in heat-sensing neurons.},

  abstract = {The TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) superfamily of cation channels is remarkable in that it displays greater diversity in activation mechanisms and selectivities than any other group of ion channels. The domain organizations of some TRP proteins are also unusual, as they consist of linked channel and enzyme domains. A unifying theme in this group is that TRP proteins play critical roles in sensory physiology, which include contributions to vision, taste, olfaction, hearing, touch, and thermo- and osmosensation. In addition, TRP channels enable individual cells to sense changes in their local environment. Many TRP channels are activated by a variety of different stimuli and function as signal integrators. The TRP superfamily is divided into seven subfamilies: the five group 1 TRPs (TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPN, and TRPA) and two group 2 subfamilies (TRPP and TRPML). TRP channels are important for human health as mutations in at least four TRP channels underlie disease.},

  abstract = {Although thermal transport is among the essential biophysical properties of proteins, its relationship with protein structures, dynamics, and functions is still elusive. The structures of folded proteins are highly inhomogeneous, giving rise to an anisotropic and non-uniform flow of thermal energy during conformational fluctuations. To illustrate the nature of proteins, we developed a theoretical framework for analyzing local thermal transport properties based on the autocorrelation function formalism, constructed a linear-homopolymer-like model, and applied it to a small {$\alpha$}-helical protein, the villin headpiece subdomain (HP36), using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, the model reproduced the exact value of the protein's thermal conductivity with an error of less than 1\%. Interestingly, the site-selective analysis of the local, residue-wise, thermal conductivity demonstrated its distinct residue-type dependence, i.e., its magnitude decreased in the order of charged, polar, and hydrophobic residues. In addition, the local density dependence of the residue-wise thermal transport property was also discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 3 (TRPV3), a member of the thermosensitive TRP (thermoTRPV) channels, is activated by warm temperatures and serves as a key regulator of normal skin physiology through the release of pro-inflammatory messengers. Mutations in               trpv3               have been identified as the cause of the congenital skin disorder, Olmsted syndrome. Unlike other members of the thermoTRPV channel family, TRPV3 sensitizes upon repeated stimulation, yet a lack of structural information about the channel precludes a molecular-level understanding of TRPV3 sensitization and gating. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apo and sensitized human TRPV3, as well as several structures of TRPV3 in the presence of the common thermoTRPV agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Our results show {$\alpha$}-to-{$\pi$}-helix transitions in the S6 during sensitization, and suggest a critical role for the S4-S5 linker {$\pi$}-helix during ligand-dependent gating.},
